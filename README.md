# Pattern Recognition & Unsupervised Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of pattern recognition and machine learning projects focused on understanding **representation learning, density-based classification, and clustering behavior** through both supervised and unsupervised methods. Emphasis is placed on **geometric interpretation, visualization, and algorithmic understanding**, rather than accuracy alone.

## Projects Summary

### MNIST Classification & Latent Representation Learning
Implemented supervised digit classification and autoencoder-based representation learning on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The project explores how neural networks learn features by visualizing first-layer weights and latent space structures, comparing supervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction and generation.

### Non-Parametric Density Estimation (Parzen Windows & kNN)
Implemented Parzen Window and k-Nearest Neighbour density-based classifiers for multi-class data. The project studies bias–variance tradeoffs through parameter analysis, reduced-data experiments, and extensive visualization of class-conditional probability density functions and decision boundaries.

### K-Means Clustering with Distance Metric Analysis
Implemented K-Means clustering from scratch using Euclidean, squared Euclidean, and cosine distance metrics. Clustering behavior is evaluated using silhouette analysis for model selection and the Rand Index for external validation, highlighting how distance measures affect cluster structure and quality.
